# Careers at Inamoto & Co.

Our Github is empty, and the product group would like to change that.  We're looking for a Software Engineer to join our team.

You’re someone who is passionate about the web and what it can do. You’re curious. You like tackling new platforms, crunching data, solving problems and building a great user experience for others. You're proud of your code, but you do so much more than coding.

**You will:**

* Help build a new consumer product currently in the prototype stage.
* Conceive new product features, and then build, test and ship those ideas.
* Work closely with a terrific team already in place: full stack engineer, product designer, data analyst, and product manager.
* Develop internal processes to help us work better around source control, deployments, data reporting, testing and optimization.

**You are:**

* A conceptual thinker who is optimistic, enthusiastic, flexible, and articulate to engineers and non-engineers alike.
* Excited by learning new languages and platforms as the need arises.
* Someone with experience building both front-end and back-end technology.
* Someone who can determine the right technical approaches for the task at hand.
* Comfortable working with the cloud and the command line.

**You have:**
* Experience building user interfaces with code.
* Experience using source control and automated builds.
* Experience building cloud-based services and/or APIs.
* Experience evaluating, integrating and troubleshooting 3rd party APIs, SDKs and libraries.
* A portfolio of work that includes software that is public and has been used by others.

This is a full time, on-site position in our office in Gowanus, Brooklyn. We offer competitive compensation, benefits, an informal office environment and respect for individual contribution. We listen to music, have lunch together and appreciate good snacks. We rely heavily on each other to deliver the best work possible.
