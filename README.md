# Careers at Inamoto & Co.

Our Github is empty, and the product group would like to change that.  We're looking for both Creative Technologists and Associate Software Engineers to join our team.

Both roles are for people who are passionate about the web and what it can do.

**You will:**
* Help build a new consumer product currently in the prototype stage.
* Conceive new product features, and then build, test and ship those ideas.
* Develop internal processes to help us work better around source control, deployments, data reporting, testing and optimization.
* Work closely with a terrific team already in place: full stack engineer, product designer, data analyst, and product manager.

**You are:**
* Someone who likes to make things.
* A conceptual thinker who is optimistic, enthusiastic, flexible, and articulate to engineers and non-engineers alike.
* Someone who thinks and works full-stack and isn't afraid of the cloud or the command line.
* Excited by learning new languages and platforms as the need arises.

**You have:**
* Experience building user interfaces with code.
* Experience using source control.
* Experience working with cloud-based services and/or APIs.
* Some sample projects that are live and can be viewed publicly.

The Associate Software Engineer is right for someone relatively new to coding who would like to learn hands-on in a professional environment. The Creative Technologist position is for someone with more professional experience who is looking to bring their depth of skills and help us define how we work.

This is a full time, on-site position in our office in Gowanus, Brooklyn. We offer competitive compensation, benefits, an informal office environment and respect for individual contribution. We listen to music, have lunch together and appreciate good snacks. We rely heavily on each other to deliver the best work possible.
